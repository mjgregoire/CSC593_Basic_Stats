# basic_stats

- An example repository for publishing python modules/packages on github using a basic stats module created by me for CSC593.
- This module can determine the sum, mean, variance, and standard deviation of a list of numbers defined as "x". 
- It can also tell the percent of values within +/- 1 standard deviation of the mean as well as if the values are normally distributed or if they are skewed left or right.
